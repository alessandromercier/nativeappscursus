        <h2 id="section-four">Course organisation</h2>
        <p>
            The lessons are organized in 12 lessons, where we will go over the theoretical aspects
            in the first hour, where the second hour will be used to put the things learned into practice
            during an excercie.
            Normally you will not be able to complete the excercise in one hour so it is up to 
            you to complete the excercise at home. If you encounter any difficulties in the excerise
            you are welcome to ask questions in the next lesson (or via e-mail). 
        </p>


        <div class="panel panel-warning">
            <div class="panel-heading">Don't forget!</div>
            <div class="panel-body">Although some of the lessons are taught in computer classes, we will not work with these computers. It 
                is up to you to bring your own laptop to class.</div>
        </div>

        <h2 id="section-five">Examination</h2>

        <p>
            Both for the first as for the second exam periode, you will be examined via an oral exam. 
            You will be handed a set of questions which you will have some time to 
            prepare for. Some of the questions will be regarding the excercises you have made during the year, so 
            <b> you are obliged to have made all the excercises</b>. If your question is one regarding an excercise you
            have not made, you will receive a 0 on that question. 
        </p>
        Working together on the excercies is encouraged, but make sure that 
        <ol>
            <li> You have programmed and written the code yourself. I will ask difficult questions and it is very difficult to answer
                when you have not written the code yourself.
            <li> Document your code well! Make sure you remember why you have written something the way you have.</li>
        </ol>
