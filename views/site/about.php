                <p>
                    The lessons are organized in 12 lessons, where we will go over the theoretical aspects
                    in the first hour, where the second hour will be used to put the things learned into practice
                    during an excercie.
                    Normally you will not be able to complete the excercise in one hour so it is up to 
                    you to complete the excercise at home. If you encounter any difficulties in the excerise
                    you are welcome to ask questions in the next lesson (or via e-mail). 
                </p>
                <h2 id="section-five">Prior knowledge</h2>
                <p>
                    This course assumes that you know Java at this point. If you do not, you will need to
                    learn Java before you go much further. You do not need to know everything about
                    Java, as Java is vast. Rather, focus on:
                <ul>
                    <li>Language fundamentals (flow control, etc.)</li>
                    <li>Classes and objects</li>
                    <li>Methods and data members</li>
                    <li>Public, private, and protected</li>
                    <li>Static and instance scope</li>
                    <li>Exceptions</li>
                    <li>Threads</li>
                    <li>Collections</li>
                    <li>Generics</li>

                <p>
                    Both for the first as for the second exam period, you will be examined via an oral exam. 
                    You will be handed a set of questions which you will have some time to 
                    prepare for. Some of the questions will be regarding the excercises you have made during the year, so 
                    <b> you are obliged to have made all the excercises</b>. If your question is one regarding an excercise you
                    have not made, you will receive a 0 on that question. 
                </p>
                Working together on the excercies is encouraged, but make sure that 
                <ol>
                    <li> You have programmed and written the code yourself. I will ask difficult questions and it is very difficult to answer
                        when you have not written the code yourself.
                    <li> Document your code well! Make sure you remember why you have written something the way you have.</li>
